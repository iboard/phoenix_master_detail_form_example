# Jukebox

A simple POC to play around with master/detail in forms


Jukebox
  - Has Albums

Album
  - Has Tracks


The Album Edit form provides a list of all existing tracks
and fields to add a new track.

Each existing track has a link to delete the track
The fields for a new track are removed if not used/filled out.
